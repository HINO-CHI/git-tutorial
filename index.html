    Re: Eileen Dover university application
    
    Dear Eileen,
    
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    
    Starting dates
    
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    
    First semester: 9 September 2016
    Second semester: 15 January 2017
    Third semester: 2 May 2017
    
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
    
    You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
